<h1>General guidebook</h1>
<p>Xaiecon has some features not seen on any other social networks, it's unique
and innovative. Here is a small guidebook for all your questions and general terminology</p>
<h2>Terminology</h2>
<h3>Board</h3>
<p>A board is a community or forum where people can post about a topic, either defined
on the name or the description. Each board has a moderator (team or solo) set of persons
who are in charge of enforcing the board's own rules.</p>
<h3>Post</h3>
<p>Think of a post like a text you share on internet, basically you share post(s) on
boards that other users can see.</p>
<h3>Subscribing and following</h3>
<p>If a board interests you, or you simply like the "feel" of it, you can subscribe to
it, doing so will make all posts about that board appear in your feed. You can subscribe
to multiple boards.<br>If a specific user is in your interests you can also follow him
and all their posts will appear in your feed. You can also receive notifications if you
wish. Altho this is only for follows.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>Anti-namesquatting</h3>
<p>Most problems a social network has is that they think "first come, first serve"
ideology is ever going to work, if they really aim at free speech they are throwing
rocks at the fire and hoping it to wash out.<br><br>
Xaiecon is more like "anyone who comes gets served". If someone takes
<a href='/b/gaming'>/b/gaming</a> and then starts banning everyone because "they can"
there are two scenarios:</p>
<ul>
	<li><h4>Anyone who comes gets served</h4>
	Users simply make another /b/gaming, and the /b/gaming where everyone was banned
	slowly dies out. This is the goal of mantaining boards active and comfortable
	to everyone</li>
	<li><h4>First come, first serve</h4>
	Users make another board named /b/gaming2, but /b/gaming already has the
	nametag, which is what matters if you want to be finded out. So /b/gaming2
	just becomes another dissent and dies out. The opposite of the wanted,
	this will cause that group of users to leave the platform altogether</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to "Anyone who comes gets served", Xaiecon believes boards should
be known for being active, and not for being the newest or trending boards. Users
and moderators alike should help make the board grow.</p>
<h3>Make as many boards as you want!</h3>
<p>Make 20 or even 30 boards, but take in account you need to be active with them, otherwise
they will pass to second plane. This incentives namesquatters to actually post
stuff.</p>
<h2>Philosophy</h2>
<p>If you just want cat pics or funny videos. Skip over.</p>
<p>A bunch of social networking websites announce themesleves as "free speech",
this is true for the majority of them. But there is an element which is lacking
on most of them, which is the two sides: Often one side is missing
or is too small to be ever relevant. Why? Well, most websites like this ends
up being filled with one side only.
Honestly i am neutral about all this "pick sides" stuff.<br><br>
The bad thing is that if you end up with a website filled with one side, the
other side will decrement in size, making less prescense for it.<br><br>
To solve this; i plan on trying to balance the site's side. Neither one or another
just inbetwen<br><br>
A problem most websites like this one have is that they do not care engough about
users, or they do care but do not have communication with them.<br><br>
Having communication with the users is the best thing a platform can have, users
give you feedback about your platform which is invaluable. This can give you a general
idea of what you are doing right and wrong. Knowing your userbase, and making them
happy will surely bring lot of good stuff, and good reputation overall.<br><br>
In short: Xaiecon tries to fix all the quirks most social networks have, tries
to be different than all that social networks by doing unique stuff not seen
on any other social network site. </p>
